# Notes

- Make sure that each title is processed independently.
- Focus on accurately determining whether the scandal involves a private company or not, reliably extracting the names without inferring beyond the provided information, and identifying listed companies and their tickers where relevant.
- Any ambiguity in the title should be resolved conservatively—do not assume details not explicitly stated.
